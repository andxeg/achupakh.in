## About me

Hi! I'm a physics PhD student at the University of Manchester.
I investigate the fundamental properties of our universe with the
[LHCb experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/)
at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](http://home.cern).
My work mostly consists of solving problems through large scale data processing,
machine learning and careful application of statistics.

This blog is mostly about things that I find interesting or that I think could
be helpful for others. I'm interested in 

 - Learning new programming languages (Like Go, Rust, Haskell, ...)
 - Using Linux to do cool stuff
 - Cryptography
 - Machine learning and statistics
 - Web development
 - Quantum mechanics and quantum computing
 - And many other things

I also love contributing to open source projects in my free time.
Check out my projects [on Github](https://github.com/ibab)!
