## About me

Hi! I'm a physics PhD student studying at the University of Manchester.
I investigate the fundamental properties of our universe with the
[LHCb experiment](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb-public/)
at the Large Hadron Collider at [CERN](http://home.cern).
My work mostly consists of processing our experimental data using large scale
data processing techniques and interpreting it using machine learning and
statistics.

This blog is about interesting things I've found or random things that I think
could be helpful for others.
I like contributing to open source projects in my free time.
Check out my projects [on Github](https://github.com/ibab)!
